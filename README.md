# 💧 Water Pollution & Public Health Analysis  
**📘 6th Semester Data Science Project by Rudri Pandya**

---

## 📌 Objective  
This project explores how **water quality impacts public health** by analyzing pollution data across different countries and years. The goal was to uncover patterns linking water contamination to disease prevalence using Python and statistical methods.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset  
- 3000 rows × 24 columns  
- Covers multiple countries and years  
- Key parameters:  
  - Turbidity (NTU)  
  - pH Level  
  - Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)  
  - Nitrate & Lead Concentration  
  - Temperature  
  - Rainfall  
  - Healthcare Access Index  

---

## 📊 Techniques & Methods  
- **Descriptive Statistics**  
  - Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Variance, Range, IQR, Skewness, Kurtosis  
- **Inferential Statistics**  
  - T-Test
- **Machine Learning**  
  - Linear Regression  

---

## 📌 Key Insights  
- 🇮🇳 India, 🇧🇩 Bangladesh, 🇵🇰 Pakistan: High contamination, poor healthcare access  
- 🇹🇭 Thailand, 🇨🇳 China: Strong water infrastructure → Better WQI & health  
- Surface water and unprotected wells are linked to higher health risks  
- Rainwater harvesting and piped systems offer safer alternatives
